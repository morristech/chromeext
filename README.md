# Verified.ninja Chrome Browser Extension

This project is on an indefinite hiatus. The website, https://verified.ninja, is no longer available online
so all the code is now open source.

The web application can be found [here](https://github.com/verifiedninja/webapp).

## Overview

One of the predominate issues in online dating today is people don't look like their photos.
It's very easy for one person to impersonate another, upload old photos, and even use camera tricks/Photoshop
to make themselves look different from how they look today.

We designed a service where members of a dating website can create an account and then upload photos of themselves
that meet strict requirements.

When you browse a dating website (only OKCupid and ChristianMingle) are currently supported, 
this Chrome extension will place either a green ninja logo next to members that have a Verified.ninja
status on the website or will place a red ninja logo next to members that don't have a Verified.ninja
status.

## Feedback

All feedback is welcome. This code is no longer maintained, but can be used as a real-world example of how to build a Chrome
extension.
